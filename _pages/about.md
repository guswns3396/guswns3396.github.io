My research interests center on **developing and applying advanced statistical and computational methods to address critical challenges in healthcare, with a particular focus on brain-related disorders**. I aim to use these computational approaches to bridge the gap between clinical research and practical interventions in mental health and neuroscience. Additionally, I am eager to explore how the complexities of healthcare delivery and neuroscience can not only reveal the limitations of current methods but also inspire the development of more effective, adaptable AI solutions.

I am currently a Research Data Analyst in the <a href="https://williamspanlab.com/">PanLab</a>  under the guidance of Dr. Leanne Williams, within the Department of Psychiatry and Behavioral Sciences at Stanford School of Medicine. Our research focuses on understanding the heterogeneity of depression by identifying subtypes characterized by distinct brain circuits and treatment responses. <u>The ultimate goal of our lab is to move beyond the current one-size-fits-all approach and develop personalized interventions that could significantly reduce the burden of depression, ideally by at least half</u>.

Previously, I worked in the <a href="https://med.stanford.edu/cibsr.html">Center for Interdisciplinary Brain Sciences Research</a>, <a href="https://med.stanford.edu/edresearch">Eating Disorders Research Program</a>, and <a href="https://med.stanford.edu/psychiatry/research/robertsethicslab.html">Empiricial Ethics Group</a>. My experience across these diverse labs deepened my understanding of clinical trials, translational research, and the ethical challenges inherent in healthcare and scientific investigation.

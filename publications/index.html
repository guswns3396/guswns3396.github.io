A sequentially randomized vignette method was used to test the impact of initial assessments and AI output on physician decision-making patterns. Physicians were significantly more likely to change their decisions when the AI recommendation was misaligned with their initial assessment, especially when AI recommended treatment.

Family-based treatment (FBT) is the leading evidence-based intervention for adolescent anorexia nervosa, involving parents in renourishment and behavior interruption. Despite its effectiveness, challenges in distress tolerance and emotion regulation during high-stress situations, such as mealtimes, contribute to suboptimal treatment outcomes, with only 35% to 50% of adolescents achieving full recovery. Enhancing distress tolerance skills during FBT may improve treatment responses and recovery rates. The BALANCE mobile app was developed to address this need, offering real-time, dialectical behavior therapy (DBT)–based distress tolerance skills to support adolescents and families during mealtimes. Objective: Our aim was to explore the feasibility and acceptability of a mobile app designed to deliver distress tolerance skills to adolescents with and adolescents without anorexia nervosa. When fully programmed and optimized, we plan to use the mobile app to improve distress tolerance during mealtimes for adolescents with anorexia nervosa undergoing FBT. Methods: BALANCE was developed collaboratively with Stanford University’s Center for Biodesign, leveraging the expertise of clinical psychologists and using biodesign student input and the Stanford Spezi ecosystem. The app underwent an iterative development process, with feedback from adolescent users. The initial feasibility and acceptability of the app were assessed through self-reported questionnaires and structured interviews with 24 adolescents aged 12 to 18 years, including 4 diagnosed with anorexia nervosa and 20 healthy controls. Adolescents with anorexia nervosa specifically used the app during mealtimes, and healthy controls used it as needed. Participants assessed the app’s usability, perceived effectiveness, and its impact on their distress tolerance. Results: The app demonstrated high usability and acceptability. Of 24 participants, 83% (n=20) reported enjoying the app, 88% (n=21) would recommend it to peers, and 100% (n=24) found it user-friendly. Adolescents with anorexia nervosa reported that BALANCE helped them manage stressful mealtimes more effectively, highlighting features such as guided meditation, breathing exercises, and gamification elements as particularly effective. Healthy controls provided additional feedback, confirming the app’s broad appeal to the target audience and potential scalability. Preliminary findings suggest that BALANCE may enhance distress tolerance in adolescents with and adolescents without anorexia nervosa. Conclusions: BALANCE shows promise as an innovative mobile health intervention for enhancing distress tolerance in adolescents with anorexia nervosa. Its user-friendly design and tailored DBT-based skills make it a feasible tool for integration into FBT. Future research should explore its integration into clinical practice and its impact on treatment outcomes. As distress tolerance skills are relevant to a range of mental health conditions, future research may also expand BALANCE’s application to broader adolescent populations.</p> </div> <div class="bibtex hidden"> <figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-bibtex" data-lang="bibtex"><span class="nc">@article</span><span class="p">{</span><span class="nl">Miranda2025</span><span class="p">,</span>

This pilot case series describes outcome data for 20 children ages 6–12 years old with a diagnosis of ARFID and who are low-weight. Method Participants were recruited nationwide as part of an ongoing randomized clinical trial. All participants in this study received a 14-session psychoeducational and motivational treatment (PMT) protocol. Parents completed measures of ARFID severity (the Pica, ARFID, Rumination Disorder Interview) and parental self-efficacy (Parents vs. ARFID scale). Height and weight were self-reported by parents and percent of estimated body weight (%EBW) was calculated. Assessments occurred at baseline, 1-month within treatment, 2-months within treatment, end-of-treatment (EOT), and 6-month follow-up. Results Twenty children (10.34 ± 1.76 years; 85% Non-Hispanic; 75% White; 70% female; 84.16 ± 4.66% EBW) with low-weight ARFID and their parents received PMT-ARFID with a clinician specializing in eating disorders. By EOT, PARDI severity scores decreased (large effect size) parental self-efficacy increased (medium effect size), but %EBW remained unchanged.

The primary contribution of this paper is our proposal of a novel vignette study design: “SMART vignettes.” Our design has two notable features: the first is its use of sequential randomization, which conceptually originates from the sequential multiple assignment randomization trial (SMART) design developed by Murphy (2004). The second feature is adaptive allocation. These new features in vignette studies offer unique advantages not offered by traditional vignettes: (1) valid causal inferences on the conditional distributions of the primary outcome of interest, given other factors, (2) balanced allocations across groups, and (3) a greater degree of interactivity for the survey respondent. We illustrate the utility of our method using a case example of a vignette study used to probe physicians’ attitudes toward an AI-embedded clinical system. In this example, a SMART vignette was used to randomize hypothetical scenarios to gain a better understanding of the causal impact of physician attitudes, given emerging evidence that a range of factors including previous decisions, play a role in influencing clinical decisions. We simulated hypothetical vignette studies under both SMART and conventional (i.e. single randomization at baseline) designs. We varied the number of factors for each study and fixed each factor to have two levels. Relative loss was used to compare the degree of imbalance between groups. Both designs had smaller relative losses with larger sample sizes. The SMART study design had lower loss than its conventional counterpart for all values of N for all studies, indicating better balance. As demonstrated by the relative loss in our simulations, our proposed SMART vignette design has an advantage over the conventional design. This method holds promise in generating new knowledge in decision making scenarios occurring over multiple and discrete time points.</p> </div> <div class="bibtex hidden"> <figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-bibtex" data-lang="bibtex"><span class="nc">@article</span><span class="p">{</span><span class="nl">Kim2024</span><span class="p">,</span>

Vignette studies provide a means to explore emerging hypotheses regarding how context-specific factors, such as clinical risk, the amount of information provided about the AI, and the AI result, may impact physician acceptance and use of AI-based CDS tools. To best anticipate how such factors influence the decision-making of frontline physicians in clinical scenarios involving AI decision-support tools, hypothesis-driven research is needed that enables scenario testing before the implementation and deployment of these tools. Objective: This study’s objectives are to (1) design an original, web-based vignette-based survey that features hypothetical scenarios based on emerging or real-world applications of AI-based CDS systems that will vary systematically by features related to clinical risk, the amount of information provided about the AI, and the AI result; and (2) test and determine causal effects of specific factors on the judgments and perceptions salient to physicians’ clinical decision-making. Methods: US-based physicians with specialties in family or internal medicine will be recruited through email and mail (target n=420). Through a web-based survey, participants will be randomized to a 3-part “sequential multiple assignment randomization trial (SMART) vignette” detailing a hypothetical clinical scenario involving an AI decision support tool. The SMART vignette design is similar to the SMART design but adapted to a survey design. Each respondent will be randomly assigned to 1 of the possible vignette variations of the factors we are testing at each stage, which include the level of clinical risk, the amount of information provided about the AI, and the certainty of the AI output. Respondents will be given questions regarding their hypothetical decision-making in response to the hypothetical scenarios. Results: The study is currently in progress and data collection is anticipated to be completed in 2024. Conclusions: The web-based vignette study will provide information on how contextual factors such as clinical risk, the amount of information provided about an AI tool, and the AI result influence physicians’ reactions to hypothetical scenarios that are based on emerging applications of AI in frontline health care settings. Our newly proposed “SMART vignette” design offers several benefits not afforded by the extensively used traditional vignette design, due to the 2 aforementioned features. These advantages are (1) increased validity of analyses targeted at understanding the impact of a factor on the decision outcome, given previous outcomes and other contextual factors; and (2) balanced sample sizes across groups. This study will generate a better understanding of physician decision-making within this context.</p> </div> <div class="bibtex hidden"> <figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-bibtex" data-lang="bibtex"><span class="nc">@article</span><span class="p">{</span><span class="nl">Kim:Yang:2023</span><span class="p">,</span>

There is limited evidence on treatments for ARFID, and in particular, treatments for children in the outpatient setting. Pilot data suggest that Family-Based Treatment (FBT) modified for ARFID is efficacious, and that improvements in parental self-efficacy may be the mechanism behind its success. This manuscript describes a study protocol seeking to confirm these preliminary findings through an adequately powered, randomized clinical trial (RCT). METHODS: This trial will randomize 100 children ages 6-12 years old who meet DSM-5 criteria for ARFID and their families to receive either 14 telehealth sessions of FBT-ARFID (n = 50) or a manualized Psychoeducational Motivation Therapy (PMT) treatment (n = 50), an individual therapy addressing the child’s understanding of the problems ARFID is causing and promoting non-behavioral motivation and exploration of changing their eating patterns. Masked assessments will be conducted at baseline, one and two months within treatment, end-of-treatment, and six-month follow-up. Primary outcomes include change in body weight, parental self-efficacy, and parent feeding behaviors between baseline and end-of-treatment. CONCLUSIONS: The results of this RCT will advance our understanding of effective treatments for low-weight ARFID in youth.</p> </div> <div class="bibtex hidden"> <figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-bibtex" data-lang="bibtex"><span class="nc">@article</span><span class="p">{</span><span class="nl">VanWye:Yang:2023</span><span class="p">,</span>

While family-based treatment (FBT) is a first-line treatment for adolescent anorexia nervosa (AN), private practice clinicians experience difficulties receiving training in evidence-based treatments such as FBT. This report outlines the study protocol for a randomized control trial (RCT) training private practice clinicians in FBT for adolescent AN (NCT04428580). Methods: In this study, we intend to recruit 140 private practice mental health practitioners and randomize them to complete either a standard webinar-based online training or an enhanced online training that incorporates additional modules related to the putative mechanisms of treatment effect in FBT (i.e., use of externalization and agnosticism). Following the training, participants will begin expert case consultation for an adolescent with AN using FBT from their private practice. Conclusion: Based on preliminary studies suggesting the importance of enhanced skills related to agnosticism and externalization, we hypothesize that feasibility data will support a larger randomized clinical trial (RCT) and that the enhanced training arm will significantly improve FBT knowledge and skills compared to the standard webinar training arm. We also expect that patient weight gain early in treatment will be associated with clinician fidelity to the inventions used in FBT regardless of training type.

One potential application is mobile health, where the goal is to promote the user’s health through personalized interventions based on user specific information acquired through wearable devices. Important considerations include the type of, and frequency with which data is collected (e.g. GPS, or continuous monitoring), as such factors can severely impact app performance and users’ adherence. In order to balance the need to collect data that is useful with the constraint of impacting app performance, one needs to be able to assess the usefulness of variables. Bandit feedback data are sequentially correlated, so traditional testing procedures developed for independent data cannot apply. Recently, a statistical testing procedure was developed for the actor-critic bandit algorithm. An actor-critic algorithm maintains two separate models, one for the actor, the action selection policy, and the other for the critic, the reward model. The performance of the algorithm as well as the validity of the test are guaranteed only when the critic model is correctly specified. However, misspecification is frequent in practice due to incorrect functional form or missing covariates. In this work, we propose a modified actor-critic algorithm which is robust to critic misspecification and derive a novel testing procedure for the actor parameters in this case.</p> </div> <div class="bibtex hidden"> <figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-bibtex" data-lang="bibtex"><span class="nc">@inproceedings</span><span class="p">{</span><span class="nl">Kim:Yang:2022</span><span class="p">,</span>

While PVS mapping becomes more clinically relevant, separation of PVS from white matter hyperintensities (WMH) make it challenging to map PVS on clinical data. Here we present a semi-supervised multi-modal approach to extract both PVS and WMH using T1w and FLAIR image modalities automatically.
